In this folder are the processed data files and analyses for our first four
experiments, run01-run04. Each folder contains all data necessary to knit the
respective \*.Rmd file into an \*.md file, which can be viewed directly on
GitHub.

If you would like to use the SwabSeq pipeline
to process the data from these runs from beginning to end, please let us know
and we will provide the fastq files.
