In this folder are the processed data files and analyses for our first four
experiments, run01-run04. Each folder contains all data necessary to knit the
\*.Rmd file contained within it. If you would like to use the SwabSeq pipeline
to process the data from these runs from beginning to end, please let us know
and we will provide the fastq files.
